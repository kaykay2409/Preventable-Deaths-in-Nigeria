# Preventable-Deaths-In-Nigeria

A Project On The Nigeria City Village Death Accessing The Link Between Preventable Deaths And The Availability Of Hospitals And Medicine.
## Introduction
Preventable deaths remain a major concern in Nigeria, particularly in rural areas where access to quality healthcare is often limited. This project analyzes the “Nigeria City and Village Death Records” dataset to explore whether access to hospitals and medicine reduces preventable deaths and to identify demographic patterns that inform better healthcare strategies.

## Project Objectives
- Examine the relationship between healthcare access (medicine and hospitals) and preventable deaths.
- Examine the differences between preventable death in the village and city.
- Identify differences in symptoms, demographics, and outcomes between cities and villages.
- Generate visual insights to support data-driven public health decisions.
